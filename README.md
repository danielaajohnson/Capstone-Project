# Summary of this Project and How to Run the Code
This project aims to predict passenger satisfaction with U.S. airlines using the most relevant and highly correlated features. To find these features multiple methods are used: the correlation matrix, forward feature selection, linear regression coefficients and magnitudes, and the random forest model. The order of importance of the features from each method are compared and then the features are selected. KNN and Decision Trees are then implemented to predict whether a passenger is 'satisfied' or 'neutral or dissatisfied' with their flight. The results and accuracies from each model are then compared to determine which model best represents the data. To run the program successfully "train.csv" and "test.csv" must be in the same folder as the code.
